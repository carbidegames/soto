# Sample SoTo Project
This is a SoTo example project. It shows various concepts in the SoTo asset
pipeline.

## First time setup
After setting up a SoTo project for the first time, you should create a
*SoTo.Local.toml* file to tell SoTo where to find the game you're building for.
```toml
[game]
bin = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Team Fortress 2\\bin"
content = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Team Fortress 2\\tf"
```
